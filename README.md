# Hands-on-with-Cloud-Networking
I design and build secure, scalable, highly available AWS cloud architectures. This repo highlights my work in IaC, CI/CD, networking, serverless, containers, monitoring, and cost-optimized DevOps solutions.

## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

I’m learning cloud networking because it’s a core skill for becoming a Cloud Engineer. I want to understand how cloud resources communicate securely, how traffic flows inside a VPC, and how to design networks that are scalable, private, and reliable.

Many real-world cloud systems depend on VPCs, subnets, routing, and security controls, and I want hands-on experience building these from the ground up, not just theory. This will also help me confidently work with AWS services, troubleshoot networking issues, and meet the networking requirements commonly listed in cloud and DevOps job roles.

Businesses traditionally had to buy, own, and maintain physical networking equipment like servers, routers, cables, and data centers. This meant high upfront costs, ongoing maintenance, hiring specialized staff, and planning for peak usage even when resources sat idle.

Cloud networking changed things by allowing businesses to create and manage networks virtually using cloud providers like AWS. Instead of owning physical hardware, companies use software-defined networks that run on AWS’s infrastructure. AWS handles the physical equipment and data centers, while businesses focus on securely connecting resources, controlling traffic, and scaling as needed, paying only for what they use.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

I will set aside 8– 10 hours every week to work on this networking series, completing 3–4 projects per week so I can move forward consistently without rushing.

I will keep myself accountable by tracking each completed project, writing short notes on what I learned, and not moving to the next project until I fully understand how traffic flows and security rules work in the VPC.

My reward is a strong foundation in AWS networking, a completed hands-on project series to showcase on my resume and GitHub, and the confidence to design and troubleshoot real cloud networks.

### What are networks?

Computer networks are a collection of devices that can exchange data packets. These data packets travel between devices using IP addresses as destinations. As the packets move through the network, they create network traffic. 

### What is a VPC?

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a private, virtual network inside AWS where you control how your cloud resources communicate with each other and with the internet. It’s like having your own isolated section of the AWS network, where you decide IP address ranges, traffic rules, and security boundaries.

This helps organizations by giving them full control over network design and security. Companies can keep sensitive systems private, safely expose public services, manage traffic flow between resources, and build scalable architectures without managing physical network hardware. VPCs make cloud environments more secure, organized, and reliable.

# Set Up An AWS Account

This project walks through the foundational steps of creating and securing a new AWS account, including billing configuration, IAM setup, MFA enforcement, security best practices, and initial account hardening to establish a secure cloud environment.

## Getting Started with the AWS Free Tier

## Getting Started With AWS

Setting up my AWS account took just a few minutes.AWS asks for your credit card details only to verify your identity and prevent fraud. You won’t be charged unless:

The first projects I'm working on are: Set Up an AWS Account, host a Website on Amazon S3, Visualize Data with QuickSight, Cloud security with AWS IAM.
I'll do the first project on Tuesday 13th May, 2025.  I'll make time for doing projects by 1 hour

## AWS Free Tier

When you sign up for Amazon Web Services (AWS), you automatically get access to the AWS Free Tier, which provides limited free usage of several AWS services for a 12-month period (and some services are always free, within limits). 

The AWS Free Tier includes three different types of free offers, Free Trials, 12 months free and always free

After my 12-month Free Tier period ends, I'll still have access to... I'll stop getting free access to... I will set a Calendar Reminder one month before the Free Tier expires (in Google Calendar, Outlook, or your phone).
