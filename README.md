# Hands-on-with-Cloud-Networking
I design and build secure, scalable, highly available AWS cloud architectures. This repo highlights my work in IaC, CI/CD, networking, serverless, containers, monitoring, and cost-optimized DevOps solutions.

# Set Up An AWS Account

This project walks through the foundational steps of creating and securing a new AWS account, including billing configuration, IAM setup, MFA enforcement, security best practices, and initial account hardening to establish a secure cloud environment.

## Getting Started With AWS

Setting up my AWS account took just a few minutes.AWS asks for your credit card details only to verify your identity and prevent fraud. You won’t be charged unless:

The first projects I'm working on are: Set Up an AWS Account, host a Website on Amazon S3, Visualize Data with QuickSight, Cloud security with AWS IAM.
I'll do the first project on Tuesday 13th May, 2025.  I'll make time for doing projects by 1 hour

## AWS Free Tier

When you sign up for Amazon Web Services (AWS), you automatically get access to the AWS Free Tier, which provides limited free usage of several AWS services for a 12-month period (and some services are always free, within limits). 

The AWS Free Tier includes three different types of free offers, Free Trials, 12 months free and always free

After my 12-month Free Tier period ends, I'll still have access to... I'll stop getting free access to... I will set a Calendar Reminder one month before the Free Tier expires (in Google Calendar, Outlook, or your phone).
